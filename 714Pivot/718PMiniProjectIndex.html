            <p>Pivot Technology School has been very intriguing so far. It is a lot of inofomration to take in for a short period of time but it allows me to self-sufficient and learn on my own.</p><br><br>

            <p>As Joshua Mundy stated in orientation, "Once you Commit, You cannot quit". That's my daily motivation and im not a quitter. I have met challenges in life before that i was unsure of if i could be a success and everytime i doubted myself i surprised myself by succeeding.</p><br><br>

            <p>My ultimate goal in learning how to code is to get more understanding of computer language, a career change for my family, and of course a feeling of finanacial freedom</p><br><br>
